                    <textarea>Hey {name}, {name} is one of the cutest names ever, I just adored every {name} Iâ€™ve ever met. What I would say to you is go for it and try out, but also donâ€™t feel rushed and pressured to figure it out now. I am assuming you are a teen, sorry if Im wrong, but itâ€™s ruff to figure who you are, I see some teens going as if wondering for a few months is a live or die in a rush kind a thing, but everyone has their own pace, take your time, not saying it has to wait for ever but just, take your time. I wish you all the luck and love ðŸ’•</textarea>
